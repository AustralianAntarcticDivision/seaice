# seaice dev

* For NSIDC sources we now have argument `.local_root`, to override read from FTP and use the local files instead. 

* Add AMSR2 3km files. 

* Renamed functions to be more consistent, so `north/south_nsidc_*` functions are removed, in favour of `nsidc_south/north`. 

* Added northern hemisphere to existing southern. 

* seaice exist.
